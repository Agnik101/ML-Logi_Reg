<h1>I implemented a logistic regression model to predict buyer behavior using the Social Network Ads dataset from Kaggle.</h1>
<br>
This project has been a fantastic journey, deepening my understanding of machine learning algorithms and their practical applications.
Dataset: Social Network Ads from Kaggle(provided)
Objective: Predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary.
Model Used: Logistic Regression
Steps Taken:
Data Preparation: Loaded and preprocessed the dataset.
Train-Test Split: Divided the data into training and test sets.
Feature Scaling: Standardized the features for optimal model performance.
Model Training: Trained the logistic regression model on the training data.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.
Visualization: Created a decision boundary plot to visualize the test set results.
